# Christian's Portfolio

A personal portfolio showcasing real projects, technical experiments, and things I build out of curiosity.

## What's inside

- A short introduction about me
- Work experience and certifications
- Selected projects I've worked on
- A Labs section with experiments and live data integrations
- Tools and technologies I use
- A way to get in touch

## Labs

The Labs section is where I explore ideas, test APIs, and build small focused experiments.
It’s less about polish and more about learning, problem-solving, and technical depth.

Examples include:
- Live statistics fetched from external APIs
- UI and UX experiments
- Small tools and technical explorations

## Tech Stack

Built with **Next.js**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**.
