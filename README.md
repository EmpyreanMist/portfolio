# Christian's Portfolio

A simple space where I share what I’ve built, what I’m learning and what I’m currently messing around with.

## What's inside

- A short intro about me
- Certifications
- My work experience in tech
- Projects I've worked on
- Tools I use
- A way to reach out

## Tech Stack

Built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind. Nothing fancy, just stuff that works and that helps me learn by doing.
