# Christian's Portfolio

A simple space where I share what I’ve built, what I’m learning, and what I’m currently messing around with.

## What's inside

- A short intro about me
- A few projects I've worked on
- Tools I use
- A way to reach out

## Tech stuff

Built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind. Nothing fancy — just stuff that works, and that helps me learn by doing.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
